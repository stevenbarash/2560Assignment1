    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    In a medium saucepan, cover the chickpeas with 2 inches of fresh water. Add
    the garlic cloves and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderately low heat until
    the chickpeas are tender, about 40 minutes. Drain, reserving 10 tablespoons
    of the cooking water and 2 tablespoons of the chickpeas. Rinse the chickpeas
    under cold water. Peel the garlic cloves.

    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    In a food processor, puree the chickpeas with 1/2 cup of the reserved
    cooking water, 1/4 cup of the olive oil and 6 of the garlic cloves. Add the
    cumin along with 1/4 cup each of the tahini and lemon juice and process
    until creamy. Season the hummus with salt and transfer to a serving bowl.

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    Wipe out the food processor. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of tahini, 1/4 cup of
    olive oil, 2 tablespoons of reserved cooking water, 1 tablespoon of lemon
    juice and garlic clove and puree.
  </li>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    Using a ladle, make an indent in the center of the hummus. Spoon in the
    tahini-lemon mixture. Sprinkle the hummus with the cumin and paprika.
    Garnish with the reserved whole chickpeas and the parsley, and serve with
    pita bread.

Make Ahead The ungarnished hummus and cooked chickpeas can be refrigerated
separately for up to 2 days. Notes Tahini has a tendency to separate, so be sure
to stir the sesame paste thoroughly before measuring.
